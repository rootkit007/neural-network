This is a learning experience in neural networking. It is alleged to support stochastic and batch learning modes, and 
standard backpropagation as well as RPROP algorithms, and uses multi-threaded model to speed up computations. It is not guaranteed to
work, or perform - use at your own risk!

There is a test case for creating NN to compute XOR, and another test case to for image recognition.
